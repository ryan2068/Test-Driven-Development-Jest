# Test Driven Development with Jest

This repository is a practice ground for test driven development using the Jest testing framework.  The project contains simple functions along with corresponding test files.  I wrote the tests first to define the expected behaviour and then implemented the functions to make the tests pass.  Working this way forced me to think through edge cases and improved my confidence in refactoring.  To run the tests, install dependencies with `npm install` and execute `npm test`.  You'll see Jest run and report pass or fail status.
